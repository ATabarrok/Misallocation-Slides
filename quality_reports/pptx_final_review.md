## Slide-by-Slide Review

### Slide 1 — Title Slide
**"Price Controls Cause Chaos"**
Authors and affiliations listed. Clean layout.

- No issues.

---

### Slide 2 — February 1974: The Oil Crisis
Opens with the 9% shortfall fact, textbook prediction of proportional reduction, and the "feast or famine" callout box. Yergin (1991) book cover image on right. Quote from Yergin in Garamond italic.

- **Missing attribution on quote.** The Yergin quote ("Gasoline was in short supply in major urban areas...") has no visible citation. The Beamer version adds "— Yergin (1991)." Add it here too.
- The "What actually happened?" / "feast or famine" box is excellent — punchy and memorable.

---

### Slide 3 — The Patchwork of Rationing
Left side: bullet points on severe rationing (CT, MA >90%; NJ, RI >60%) vs. no rationing (ID, MT, UT, WY: 0%). Right side: choropleth map. Below map: caption in Garamond.

- **Text-heavy (720 chars, 12 paragraphs).** The slide does four things at once: data, key question, answer, and map. Consider splitting the "Answer" sentence into its own emphasized block or a separate slide.
- The question/answer structure is strong but the answer ("Efficient allocation requires price variation. A binding ceiling explicitly forbids it.") is buried at the bottom. Give it more visual prominence.

---

### Slide 4 — This Paper: Four Contributions
Lists all four contributions with bold headers and descriptions at 28pt/25pt.

- Clean and well-structured. No issues.
- Good that it appears early — sets audience expectations.

---

### Slide 5 — Harberger Triangle
Left: text explaining the standard Econ 101 DWL analysis and the key question about efficient allocation. Right: supply-demand diagram with shaded Harberger triangle. Annotations in Segoe UI Historic 14pt.

- **Grammar:** "That is it assumes that the Qc of output..." → "That is**,** it assumes..." (missing comma after "That is").
- **Key insight is buried.** "How can the consumers with the highest willingness to pay outbid consumers with a lower WTP when prices are fixed by law?" — this is the central question and deserves visual emphasis (larger font, color, or a callout box).
- Figure annotations use **Segoe UI Historic 14pt** which is inconsistent with the rest of the deck.

---

### Slide 6 — Random Allocation (1 of 2)
Left: text on random allocation increasing DWL. Right: supply-demand diagram showing misallocation cost area in pink and "CS random" in blue. "Harberger Triangle" label at 12pt Segoe UI Historic.

- **12pt annotation text** is too small for a lecture hall.
- This is part of a progressive-reveal pair with Slide 7.

---

### Slide 7 — Random Allocation (2 of 2)
Left: **identical text** to Slide 6 (word-for-word). Right: slightly different diagram showing EMB (expected marginal benefit), shortage bracket, and λ = Qˢ/Qᵈ.

- **Duplicate text.** The body text is exactly the same as Slide 6 but the diagram changes significantly (adds EMB curve, shortage visualization, λ ratio). The text should evolve to guide the audience through what's new: "Under random allocation, each consumer has probability λ = Qˢ/Qᵈ of being served. The expected marginal benefit (EMB) determines the misallocation cost."
- Same 12pt annotation issue.

---

### Slide 8 — Random Allocation (Literature)
Text-only slide reviewing Glaeser & Luttmer (2003) and Bulow & Klemperer (2012), then pivoting to "market segments" as the paper's approach.

- **Typo: "Glaser"** → should be **"Glaeser"** (appears in "Glaser and Luttmer (2003) argue that 21%..."). The correct spelling "Glaeser" appears earlier in the same slide, making the inconsistency visible.
- **Grammar: "random allocation result in"** → **"results in"** (subject-verb agreement).
- "Not obvious!" is informal. Consider: "— hard to verify in practice."
- Good pivot at the end: "We study all possible allocations to different market segments."

---

### Slide 9 — Setup: Two Segments/Submarkets
*(Content in a14 equation format.)* Two-market model: demands D₁(p) and D₂(p), price ceiling p̄ creates shortage D(p̄) - S(p̄) > 0, total supply Q̄ ≡ S(p̄), feasibility constraint q₁ + q₂ = Q̄ with qᵢ ≤ Dᵢ(p̄). Closes with: "How is Q̄ split between the two markets?"

- Clean setup slide. The closing question provides good narrative momentum.
- No issues.

---

### Slide 10 — Harberger Requires Equalization of Shadow Prices
Text explaining that the Harberger triangle requires shadow price equalization across segments. Two-panel WMF diagram showing equalized shadow prices. Closes with: "Why should shadow prices equalize when fixed money prices eliminate arbitrage incentives?"

- **WMF image format** — may not render on macOS or Linux. Convert to PNG.
- **Speaker notes:** "Note we from herein we ignore production deadweight loss..." — "from herein" is awkward. Consider "henceforth."
- Good rhetorical question to close the slide.

---

### Slide 11 — An Equally Feasible Allocation
Two-panel WMF diagram showing Panel B with segment 2 at zero allocation. Text: "Note in Panel B segment 2 gets zero allocation and segment 1 gets over-allocation. Divergence of shadow prices. As a result a+b>c"

- **Formatting:** "a+b>c" needs proper spacing and math formatting → "a + b > c" or use equation format.
- **WMF image** — same cross-platform concern.
- The text is terse. Consider adding: "DWL under misallocation (a + b) exceeds the Harberger triangle (c)."

---

### Slide 12 — Harberger Triangle Is the Minimum Deadweight Loss
Geometric figure showing the feasible set as a convex region with two vertex allocations marked. Arrows point to "Vertex Allocations." Contains some a14 equation content.

- The figure needs axis labels and a brief explanation of what the axes represent (q₁ and q₂? welfare and allocation?).
- The "Vertex Allocations" label in Segoe UI Historic is the only text besides the title. Consider adding a one-line takeaway: "The Harberger triangle is a lower bound; all other feasible allocations produce more DWL."

---

### Slide 13 — Why Corners? (Intuition)
Left: transportation cost intuition — deliver to the lowest-cost market. Feasibility as a convex polytope. Right: figure showing feasible allocation set with E1, E2 vertices, iso-cost line, and demand constraints.

- **"Linear program->Corner solutions."** — ASCII arrow and missing space. Use: "Linear program → corner solutions."
- **"'Segment', 'Transport'—very general terms."** — this aside is important but may be overlooked. Consider bolding or highlighting "very general."
- The figure (feasible set under price ceiling) is excellent — clear and well-labeled.

---

### Slide 14 — Why Corners? (Four-Step Logic)
The logic chain: (1) Prices frozen → same revenue everywhere, (2) Seller indifference → cost minimization, (3) Cost min is a linear program on feasible set, (4) Linear programs solve at corners. Then the "knife-edge" comparison: market prices redirect a few tanker loads; price controls redirect **all of them**.

- **Speaker notes typo:** "When **prizes** are frozen" → should be **"prices"**.
- This is one of the strongest slides in the deck. The knife-edge comparison is memorable and precise.
- Consider visual formatting: the four steps could be numbered boxes instead of plain bullets to reinforce the logical chain.

---

### Slide 15 — From Two to Many
*(Content in a14 equation format.)* Generalizes to n submarkets. Defines "submarket" flexibility (geographic, temporal, product, production stage). Introduces the feasible set F as a convex polytope with formal set notation. Notes that F's vertices have qᵢ ∈ {0, q̄ᵢ} for all but at most one market.

- Well-structured generalization. The examples of "submarket" types (geographic, temporal, product, production) are well-chosen.
- No issues.

---

### Slide 16 — (No Title)
Text contrasts free markets (generically interior solutions maximizing welfare) vs. price controls (generically corner solutions with no welfare implications). Concludes: "One of the corner solutions under price controls is the worst case."

- **Missing title.** This is the only slide without a title. Suggest: "Free Markets vs. Price Controls" or "Interior vs. Corner Solutions."
- The content is a crisp summary but needs its title to anchor the audience.

---

### Slide 17 — Theorem 1 (Worst Case)
*(Content in a14 equation format.)* States the worst-case result: the DWL-maximizing allocation is at a corner of F with qᵢ ∈ {0, q̄ᵢ} for all but at most one market. Intuition via concavity of welfare. Characterizes the cutoff λ: markets with Pᵢ(0) ≥ λ get nothing; those with Pᵢ(0) < λ get everything.

- The theorem statement is clear and the intuition well-motivated.
- The cutoff characterization (λ) is a nice addition — makes the abstract result concrete.
- No issues.

---

### Slide 18 — Markets are Smooth
*(Content in a14 equation format.)* Free-market surplus maximization problem with integral notation. Strict concavity → unique q*(θ). Berge's Maximum Theorem → q*(θ) is continuous in θ. Punchline in large font: "Small changes in parameters → small changes in allocations and welfare."

- Beautifully formatted. The large-font punchline at the bottom is very effective.
- This sets up the contrast with Slide 19 perfectly.
- No issues.

---

### Slide 19 — Under Price Controls: Cost Minimization
*(Content in a14 equation format.)* Imposes binding ceiling p̄. Profit-maximizing suppliers minimize delivery costs: min c(θ)·q over F(θ). This is a **linear program**. With generically distinct costs: markets filled in order of increasing cost, at most one partially filled, nearly equal costs → infinitesimal change can **flip the entire allocation**. Punchline: "The equilibrium allocation becomes **discontinuous** in parameters."

- Excellent parallel structure with Slide 18. The visual echoing (same layout, contrasting conclusions) is very effective.
- The bold "flip the entire allocation" and "discontinuous" are well-placed emphasis.
- No issues.

---

### Slide 20 — The Chaos Theorem
Formal statement: adjacent vertex allocations v and w both optimal at θ*; if ΔW ≠ 0, then in every neighborhood of θ*: (1) allocation jumps discontinuously, (2) welfare jumps by ±|ΔW|. "Welfare is not locally monotone." Closing example: "A pipeline repair, a regulatory tweak, a refinery outage..."

- Well-stated. The plain-language examples at the end ground the abstract theorem.
- Consider whether the formal notation (v, w, θ*, ΔW) needs a brief visual reminder pointing back to the feasible set diagram from Slide 12/13.

---

### Slide 21 — The Chaos of Price Controls: Intuition
Side-by-side comparison image: "Free Markets" box (green, continuous, predictable) vs. "Price Controls" box (red, discontinuous, chaotic). Mathematical notation showing O(ε) changes vs. Δ ≫ ε jumps. Caption: "Price controls introduce fundamental unpredictability."

- Excellent visual summary. The green/red color coding is intuitive.
- The math notation is clean and the asymptotic comparison (O(ε) vs. Δ ≫ ε) is precisely the right level of formality.
- No issues.

---

### Slide 22 — The Chaos Theorem: Simulation
Left: description of 100-city simulation (10×10 grid, same demand, slightly different costs). Right: Figure 4 showing free market (top row, smooth orange) vs. price controls (bottom row, patchy orange/white).

- **Color description mismatch.** Text says "Red is served. Yellow is zero allocation." The figure actually shows **orange** = served and **white** = zero allocation. The cells with numbers like "2.2" are orange; empty/zero cells are white. Update the color descriptions to match the figure.
- The simulation figure is one of the strongest visuals in the deck — the contrast is immediately striking.

---

### Slide 23 — Illustration: 1971–1974 Oil Crisis
Eight-bullet historical timeline: Nixon price freeze (Aug 1971) → petroleum controls retained → Special Rule No. 1 (Aug 1973) → Oil Embargo (Oct 1973) → EPAA pro-rata allocation (1973) → exceptions and "fair and equitable" guideline → extreme dispersion.

- **Typo: "wages and prices/"** — trailing slash after "prices". Remove it.
- **Text-heavy (631 chars, 10 paragraphs).** Consider splitting into two slides: (1) Timeline: 1971–1973 policy decisions, (2) The EPAA Allocation System and its failure.
- The final line ("Despite pro-rata rules, the outcome was extreme dispersion—exactly what the Chaos Theorem predicts") is the key connection between theory and evidence. Give it more visual weight — larger font or a callout box.

---

### Slide 24 — The Data: AAA Station Surveys, February 1974
Left: *(a14 content)* Station-level classification: 10.1% closed, 27.8% limiting purchases, 62.1% operating normally. Aggregation: Open (62%) vs. Closed/Limiting (38%). q_O = 1.06, q_C ≈ 0.67. "This is the corner-solution structure predicted by the Chaos Theorem." Right: iconic "Sorry No Gas" photograph.

- The data + photo combination works well. The photo provides emotional resonance while the data provides rigor.
- **Speaker notes** mention 1979 data ("Barely 50 stations open in Connecticut...") — note the slide title says February 1974 but the notes reference 1979. If used verbally, clarify you're comparing across crises.

---

### Slide 25 — The Identification Problem
*(Content in a14 equation format.)* Chaos Theorem ⇒ corner allocations far from equilibria. Demand identified only locally. CES example: value of marginal unit → ∞ as q → 0, so marginal units have big welfare effects. Introduces **Robust Bounds** framework: given observed allocation and minimal curvature knowledge, how big/small could welfare loss be? "In theory this is a very complicated problem...Some clever math simplifies."

- This is the most text-dense of the a14 slides. The CES example is well-chosen — it shows concretely why functional form matters.
- "Some clever math simplifies" is a good teaser for a talk where you'll explain verbally. For a handout or self-reading version, you'd want the actual bound equation.
- No errors found.

---

### Slide 26 — The Chaos Mechanism in General
Two categories: **Product-mix misallocation** (crude → gasoline, diesel, heating oil; shortages rotated unpredictably) and **Temporal misallocation** (heating oil frozen at summer 1971 levels; "Freezing prices led to freezing people"). Closes with 1973 Congressional testimony quote at 28pt/20pt.

- **"Controlled prices + small cost wedges→ large shifts"** — missing space before arrow. Use "wedges → large shifts."
- The Congressional testimony quote has no speaker attribution — just "1973 Congressional testimony." Add who said it for credibility.
- "Freezing prices led to freezing people" is a great line. Consider making it a standalone callout.
- **Text-heavy (609 chars, 11 paragraphs).** Consider splitting product-mix and temporal misallocation into separate slides.

---

### Slide 27 — The Chaos Mechanism: The Baby Chicks
Left: narrative of chicken farmers killing one million baby chicks (summer 1973). Mechanism: retail prices controlled, feed costs not → revenue capped on grow-out path → abandon "raise chicks" segment. Right: WMF image (3.4 MB). Below: quote in Garamond italic: "It's cheaper to drown 'em than to put 'em down and raise 'em." — AP, 1973.

- **"Similar story with cows, and pigs."** — awkward. Consider: "The same logic applied to cattle and hogs."
- **"Cull now when future price<current price."** — missing spaces around `<`. Use: "Cull now when future price < current price." Or rephrase: "Cull now because future revenue (capped) < current feed costs."
- **"Small cost wedges->vertex"** — ASCII arrow. Use: "Small cost wedges → vertex."
- **WMF image (3.4 MB)** — very large and cross-platform fragile. Convert to PNG.
- The AP quote is memorable and well-placed.

---

### Slide 28 — Supply-Chain Breaking
Example: Propane → plastic pipe → oil wells. Oil production was prioritized but propane (essential for plastic piping) lacked priority. Suppliers sent propane wherever transport costs were low. Result: pipe shortages disrupted the oil production that policy sought to protect.

- Strong example of unintended consequences. The irony (policy to protect oil production disrupted oil production) lands well.
- "Plastics industry initially lacked priority designation and propane price was frozen. High-value demanders could not out-bid low value demanders." — could be tighter: "Plastics lacked priority status, and frozen propane prices prevented high-value buyers from outbidding low-value ones."
- No errors.

---

### Slide 29 — Political Economy
Once prices can't allocate, the market produces corner outcomes with no welfare ordering. Mandated allocation could outperform. Thus: "Shortage-chaos → demand for quantity management → regulations, inventory mandates, bureaucratic allocation."

- **Speaker notes** are interesting: "Very evident from congressional reports where many people can't understand the chaos." This context would be valuable to include on the slide itself.
- The 32pt text on the "shortage-chaos → demand for quantity management" line is the largest body text in the deck. Standardize to 28pt for consistency.
- The argument is important: price controls create demand for their own expansion. This is a political economy insight that distinguishes the paper from pure welfare analysis.

---

### Slide 30 — Summary of Results
Repeats the four contributions from Slide 4 (identical text).

- Works as a clean recap. The repetition is intentional and effective for a talk.
- No issues.

---

### Slide 31 — Final Words
Image-only: italic text reading "Whenever a ceiling fragments an integrated market — gasoline, rental housing, agriculture, medical care — the main cost is not the familiar triangle, but the **hidden misallocation** behind it. Thank you."

- Strong closing. "Hidden misallocation" is a memorable takeaway phrase.
- Consider adding contact information or a paper link below "Thank you" so the audience can follow up.

## Visual & Design Issues

### Font Inconsistency

| Font | Where | Recommendation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Garamond** (italic) | Quotes: slides 2, 3, 5, 27 | Keep — intentional quote style |
| **Segoe UI Historic** | Figure labels: slides 5, 6, 7, 12 | Replace with theme font |

### Font Size Range

Body text spans 12pt–32pt. Recommendation: standardize to 24–28pt for body, minimum 16pt for annotations.

### WMF Images

| Slide | Size | Recommendation |

## Pedagogical Suggestions

1. **Slides 6–7 (duplicate text):** The diagrams progress but the body text is identical. Update Slide 7's text to describe the new elements (EMB curve, λ ratio, shortage bracket).

2. **Slide 5 (key question):** "How can consumers with the highest WTP outbid others when prices are fixed by law?" — this is the paper's central motivating question. Give it visual prominence (callout box, larger font, or color).

3. **Slide 14 (four-step logic):** Consider numbered boxes or a step diagram instead of plain bullets. This is the argument's backbone.

4. **Slide 24 (notes mismatch):** Speaker notes reference 1979 data but the slide title says February 1974. Clarify if comparing across crises.

5. **Slide 26 (attribution):** The Congressional testimony quote needs a speaker name.

6. **Slide 31 (closing):** Consider adding a paper link or QR code below "Thank you."

---

## What Works Exceptionally Well

- **Opening puzzle** (Slides 2–3): The "feast or famine" framing + choropleth map is immediately compelling.
- **Slides 18–19 parallel structure:** "Markets are Smooth" vs. "Cost Minimization" — same layout, opposite conclusions. Brilliant.
- **Slide 21 visual:** The green/red side-by-side comparison of O(ε) vs. Δ ≫ ε is the clearest possible summary of the chaos theorem.
- **Slide 22 simulation grid:** The visual contrast between smooth free-market allocation and patchy price-control allocation is the most persuasive single image in the deck.
- **Slide 14 knife-edge:** "A one-cent advantage is as good as one dollar" — this line is worth the whole slide.
- **Slide 27 baby chicks:** Visceral, unforgettable, and perfectly illustrates the corner-solution mechanism.
- **Slide 31 closing:** "The main cost is not the familiar triangle, but the **hidden misallocation** behind it" — gives the audience a takeaway phrase they'll remember.
- **Overall narrative arc:** Puzzle → theory → chaos → evidence → broader implications → policy. Textbook structure for a research seminar.
